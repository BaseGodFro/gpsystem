**Plan for Sprint 1:**\
\
We aim to have a functional (but not nessecarily beautiful) GUI, taht can interact with a databse through use of several different Java Classes.

We also aim  to have unit tests for the testing of these classes.

Our plan for the database is to use a mysql server on our own devices.
